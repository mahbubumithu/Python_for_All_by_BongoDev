### **Slide: Understanding File Permissions in Linux**

- **What are File Permissions?**
  - File permissions determine who can read, write, or execute a file or directory.
  - Every file has three permission types:
    - **Read (r)**: Ability to view the contents of a file or list a directoryâ€™s contents.
    - **Write (w)**: Ability to modify or delete a file or its contents.
    - **Execute (x)**: Ability to run a file as a program or access a directory.

### **Slide: File Permission Structure**

- **Viewing Permissions**  
  Use `ls -l` to see permissions for files and directories:
  ```bash
  $ ls -l
  ```
  *Example output:*  
  `-rwxr-xr-- 1 user group 4096 Oct 11 10:15 script.sh`

  - **Permission Breakdown**:
    - `-rwxr-xr--`
      - The first character: `-` (file) or `d` (directory).
      - **Owner**: `rwx` (read, write, execute for the file owner).
      - **Group**: `r-x` (read, execute for users in the file's group).
      - **Others**: `r--` (read-only for all others).

### **Slide: Changing File Permissions with `chmod`**

- **Basic Syntax**:
  ```bash
  chmod <permissions> <file>
  ```

- **1. Using Numeric Mode**
  - Permissions can be represented by numbers:
    - `4` = Read (r)
    - `2` = Write (w)
    - `1` = Execute (x)
  - Combine these for different roles:
    - **Owner** | **Group** | **Others**: 777 (rwx for all), 644 (rw- for owner, r-- for group and others)

  **Example:**
  ```bash
  chmod 755 script.sh
  ```
  *This gives the owner full access (rwx), while group and others get read and execute access (r-x).*

- **2. Using Symbolic Mode**
  - Permissions can also be changed with symbols:
    - `u` = user/owner
    - `g` = group
    - `o` = others
    - `a` = all (user, group, others)

  **Example:**
  ```bash
  chmod u+x script.sh
  ```
  *This adds execute permission to the owner.*

  **Example:**
  ```bash
  chmod g-w file.txt
  ```
  *This removes write permission for the group.*

### **Slide: Common `chmod` Examples**

1. **Give execute permission to all users**:
   ```bash
   chmod a+x script.sh
   ```

2. **Remove write permission for others**:
   ```bash
   chmod o-w file.txt
   ```

3. **Set full permissions for the owner, read-only for group and others**:
   ```bash
   chmod 744 file.txt
   ```

### **Slide: Changing File Ownership with `chown`**

- **`chown`** allows you to change the owner and group of a file.
  ```bash
  chown <owner>:<group> <file>
  ```

- **Example: Change the owner to `user1` and group to `staff`**:
  ```bash
  chown user1:staff file.txt
  ```

- **Change ownership of a directory recursively**:
  ```bash
  chown -R user1:staff /path/to/directory
  ```

---

### **Slide: Viewing Effective Permissions with `stat`**

- Use `stat` to view detailed file permissions and other metadata:
  ```bash
  stat file.txt
  ```
  *This will show the numeric mode (e.g., 0644) and other attributes of the file.*

---

### **Slide: Understanding Special Permissions**

- **Setuid (Set User ID)**: Allows a file to be executed with the permissions of its owner.
  ```bash
  chmod u+s file.sh
  ```

- **Setgid (Set Group ID)**: Ensures new files created in a directory inherit the group of the directory.
  ```bash
  chmod g+s directory/
  ```

- **Sticky Bit**: Prevents users from deleting files in a directory unless they own them.
  ```bash
  chmod +t /shared_directory
  ```
